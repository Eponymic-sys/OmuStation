  # Rule 4 - Don't Self-antag

  While you can be rude, hold grudges, and even be a nuisance to an extent. You shouldn't cause any serious damage or harm to crew as a non-antagonist.

  ## Precedents

  - Don't start random fights without an in-character reason, also known as 'RDM' (Random Death Match). A drunken bar fight over an argument is fine, randomly attacking people in the halls because 'your character is insane' is not.
  - Don't over-escalate. Someone calling you stinky is not a good enough reason for you to kill them. (See the roleplay rule [textlink="don't over-escalate" link="RuleEscelation"].)
  - Don't round remove people as a non-antagonist.
  - Don't sabotage the station as a non-antagonist. Vandalizing the front of security is fine, smashing their windows and doors is not.
  - Don't steal important items as a non-antagonist. Hacking into a vending machine to steal some insuls is fine, stealing the spare ID is not.
  - Silicons following their laws are not self-antagging, but can be punished for excessive leaps of logic to perform self-antag-like actions.
  - Clowns and Mimes are partially exempt from the self-antag rules when in the pursuit of entertaining the crew, and [bolditalic][color=#ffaa00]only the self-antag rules[/color][/bolditalic]. Should Clowns and Mimes abuse this clause, then the same goes in reverse, i.e. If the crew finds their actions unfunny they may act against the Clown or Mime. Always Ahelp if in doubt regarding this clause.
